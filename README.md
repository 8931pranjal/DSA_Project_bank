# Basic information of Project
#we have prepared a banking model 
#user can create his/her account
#The user will input their details such as name, address, and contact number, and then
our model will provide them with an account number.
#Using this model, we can perform various tasks such as making deposits,
withdrawals, transfers, and checking balances.
#And other tasks such as viewing transaction history.
#In this model, we can also change our PIN, reset the PIN if it's forgotten,
and similarly update our details.
#We will save all customer data, including their details, balance, 
and transaction history, in a CSV file.
#We have written our program in the C language, and we have used 
the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure extensively.
